A single page application for stock visualizations using AngularJS, D3, ui-router, angular-material, and the Yahoo YQL API. This is completely client-side and you just need to run index. Set headers to allow access cross origin or within the browser for local use.

I am no longer hosting this app.

Add companies through the portfolio using their stock ticker. Then check out the example graph types through the indicator tab. Highlight portions of the graph to get an overlaying analysis graph. Change graph timespans by clicking the bottom clock button and highlighting the desired area (only on top graph in this version).
